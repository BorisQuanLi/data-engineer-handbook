Dimensional Data Modeling Day 1 Lab
In this video will be building a cumulative table 
design (https://github.com/EcZachly/cumulative-table-design) with 
complex data types STRUCT and ARRAY. We will take the table 
player_seasons and create a new table called players that 
holds onto an historical record of all NBA players and the seasons 
that they played!
